/**
 * Per-worker statistics collected by {@link ShardedWorker} when
 * {@link DiagnosticsConfig#enabled()} is true.
 *
 * <h3>Threading</h3>
 * Each instance is owned by exactly one worker thread. All fields are
 * mutated only from that worker's {@code run()} method, and read only
 * after the worker has terminated (post-join happens-before). No
 * volatiles, no atomics, no locks — the recording cost is a handful of
 * primitive long ops per task.
 *
 * <h3>Optional histogram</h3>
 * When {@link DiagnosticsConfig#perWorkerLatency()} is true, a
 * {@link LatencyRecorder} is attached and fed via {@code record(task)}.
 * This adds four long stores per task to the per-worker recorder
 * (allocation-free), because {@link LatencyRecorder} keeps four metrics
 * — submit overhead, queue wait, execution and end-to-end — each in its
 * own {@code long[]} buffer. Approximate raw cost:
 * {@code tasksPerWorker × 4 × 8 bytes} plus {@code LongBuffer}
 * resize / overhead. For a 10 M-task / 32-worker run this is
 * {@code ~10 MB per worker} — ~320 MB across all workers.
 *
 * <p><b>Heavy — intended for diagnostic runs with bounded
 * {@code taskCount} only.</b> Do not enable for headline throughput /
 * latency experiments; the GC pressure and resident memory will distort
 * the very tail you are trying to measure.
 *
 * <p>When the flag is false, only the cheap counters below are
 * maintained.
