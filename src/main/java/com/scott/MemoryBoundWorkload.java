/**
 * A synthetic, deterministic memory-bound workload.
 *
 * <p>Walks a shared {@code long[]} buffer either sequentially or in a
 * deterministic pseudo-random order so that cache / TLB behaviour dominates
 * the runtime. Per-task determinism comes from {@code seed}; the buffer
 * itself is allocated once (per component) by {@link TaskGenerator} and
 * shared across tasks to keep per-task allocation cost near zero.
 *
 * <h3>Read-only by default</h3>
 * <p>By default the workload only <em>reads</em> the shared buffer.
 * Writing back to a shared buffer from many concurrent worker threads
 * causes false sharing and write-back traffic that confounds queue /
 * dispatcher measurements (and is a different experimental variable
 * altogether). Pass {@code writeBack=true} to opt-in to the
 * shared-write variant for a future "memory contention" experiment.
 *
 * <p>The computed value is returned so the JIT cannot eliminate the loop.
